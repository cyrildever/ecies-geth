# CHANGELOG.md


## 1.8.0 (2025-03-14)

Features:
  - **Breaking change:** Remove `ES5` support;
  - Merge eveything into a single file;
  - Change target of the `types` path in `package.json`.

## 1.7.3 (2024-10-23)

Features:
  - Remove support for `ES3` to new default `ES5`.

## 1.7.0 (2023-11-05)

Features:

  - Remove dependency to (vulnerable) `live-server` only used for testing purpose;
  - **Breaking change:** Messages encrypted with `ecies-geth` could not be decrypted using `go-ethereum` due to an `ecies: invalid message error`. Upon analysis of the source code, a nuanced discrepancy was identified. Specifically, the issue lay in the padding of the shared key: `go-ethereum` pads the shared key with zeros when it's less than 32 bytes, a behavior not mirrored in `ecies-geth`. Follow the links for specific lines in the sources:

    https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/crypto/ecies/ecies.go#L134-L136
    https://github.com/cyrildever/ecies-geth/blob/master/lib/src/typescript/node.ts#L171

    **IMPORTANT**: This fix introduces a breaking change. Messages encrypted by the older version of this library might not be decryptable after the update, and vice versa. Users will need to be aware of this incompatibility when considering an upgrade.
